Let’s break down the code you've provided, explaining the intuition and going through it line by line.

### Intuition Behind the Code
This code implements a Boolean query evaluator. The `searchBooleanQueue` method processes a query with Boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`) and parentheses. The query is tokenized, and then operands (sets of document IDs) and operators are managed using two stacks. The result of the query is returned as a set of document IDs matching the search.

### Line-by-Line Explanation

#### `searchBooleanQueue(String query)`
This is the main method responsible for processing the query. It evaluates expressions involving the operators `AND` and `OR`.

```java
private Set<Integer> searchBooleanQueue(String query) {
    Stack<Set<Integer>> operands = new Stack<>();
    Stack<String> operators = new Stack<>();
    List<String> tokens = tokenize(query);
```

1. **`Stack<Set<Integer>> operands`**: This stack holds sets of document IDs that match specific search terms or sub-expressions. Each element in this stack represents a set of documents.
2. **`Stack<String> operators`**: This stack holds the operators (`AND`, `OR`, `(`, `)`) to determine the order in which operations should be performed.
3. **`List<String> tokens = tokenize(query)`**: This tokenizes the input query string into individual terms (words, operators, and parentheses).

#### `for (String token : tokens)`
This loop iterates over all tokens extracted from the query.

```java
    for (String token : tokens) {
        if (token.equals("(")) {
            operators.push(token);
        } else if (token.equals(")")) {
            while (!operators.empty() && operators.peek().equals("(")) {
                applyOperator(operands, operators.pop());
            }
            operators.pop();
        } else if (token.equals("AND") || token.equals("OR")) {
            while (!operators.empty() && precedence(operators.peek()) >= precedence(token)) {
                applyOperator(operands, operators.pop());
            }
            operators.push(token);
        } else {
            operands.push(searchWord(token));
        }
    }
```

1. **`if (token.equals("("))`**: When the token is `(`, we push it onto the `operators` stack. Parentheses are used to group expressions and indicate precedence in Boolean operations.
2. **`else if (token.equals(")"))`**: When the token is `)`, we apply all operators in the stack until we encounter the matching opening parenthesis `(`. This ensures that the operations within parentheses are performed first.
    - **`while (!operators.empty() && operators.peek().equals("("))`**: This ensures we stop applying operators when we reach the opening parenthesis.
    - **`applyOperator(operands, operators.pop())`**: Pops an operator from the `operators` stack and applies it to the operands.
3. **`else if (token.equals("AND") || token.equals("OR"))`**: If the token is a Boolean operator (`AND` or `OR`), we need to apply the operator with higher or equal precedence before pushing it onto the stack.
    - **`while (!operators.empty() && precedence(operators.peek()) >= precedence(token))`**: This loop ensures that we apply operators in order of precedence.
    - **`operators.push(token)`**: Once all higher precedence operators have been applied, we push the current operator onto the stack.
4. **`else`**: If the token is a word (not an operator or parenthesis), it’s treated as a search term. We call `searchWord(token)` to get a set of document IDs that contain that word, and push it onto the `operands` stack.

#### `while (!operators.isEmpty())`
After the loop through the tokens finishes, there may still be operators left in the stack. This final loop ensures that all remaining operators are applied.

```java
    while (!operators.isEmpty()) {
        applyOperator(operands, operators.pop());
    }
```

We continue popping and applying operators until the `operators` stack is empty.

#### `return operands.isEmpty() ? new HashSet<>() : operands.pop();`
Finally, we return the result of the evaluation. If the `operands` stack is empty (which should never happen unless there was an issue with the query), we return an empty set. Otherwise, we pop the final result from the `operands` stack and return it.

```java
    return operands.isEmpty() ? new HashSet<>() : operands.pop();
}
```

### Helper Methods

#### `precedence(String op)`
This method determines the precedence of the operators. It helps in deciding whether an operator should be applied immediately or pushed onto the stack for later application.

```java
private int precedence(String op) {
    if (op.equals("AND")) return 2;
    if (op.equals("OR")) return 1;
    return 0;
}
```

- **`AND`** has higher precedence than **`OR`**, so `AND` will be applied first if both are in the query.
- We return `0` for non-Boolean operators (like parentheses or words).

#### `applyOperator(Stack<Set<Integer>> operands, String op)`
This method is responsible for performing the actual Boolean operations on the operands.

```java
private void applyOperator(Stack<Set<Integer>> operands, String op) {
    Set<Integer> right = operands.pop();
    Set<Integer> left = operands.pop();
    if (op.equals("AND")) {
        left.retainAll(right); // intersection
        operands.push(left);
    } else if (op.equals("OR")) {
        left.addAll(right); // union
        operands.push(left);
    }
}
```

1. **`Set<Integer> right = operands.pop()`**: Pops the right operand (set of document IDs) from the stack.
2. **`Set<Integer> left = operands.pop()`**: Pops the left operand from the stack.
3. **`if (op.equals("AND"))`**: If the operator is `AND`, we compute the intersection of the two sets (documents that contain both terms).
4. **`else if (op.equals("OR"))`**: If the operator is `OR`, we compute the union of the two sets (documents that contain either term).
5. The result is pushed back onto the stack.

#### `tokenize(String word)`
This method splits the input query string into tokens (operators, words, and parentheses).

```java
private List<String> tokenize(String word) {
    List<String> tokens = new ArrayList<>();
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '(' || c == ')') {
            if (sb.length() > 0) {
                tokens.add(sb.toString());
                sb.setLength(0);
            }
            tokens.add(String.valueOf(c));
        } else if (Character.isWhitespace(c)) {
            if (sb.length() > 0) {
                tokens.add(sb.toString().trim());
                sb.setLength(0);
            }
        } else {
            sb.append(c);
        }
    }
    if (sb.length() > 0) {
        tokens.add(sb.toString().trim());
    }
    return tokens;
}
```

1. **`StringBuilder sb`**: This is used to accumulate characters for words as we process the query.
2. **`if (c == '(' || c == ')')`**: If the character is a parenthesis, we add it as a separate token.
3. **`else if (Character.isWhitespace(c))`**: If the character is a space, we add the current accumulated word to the token list and reset the builder.
4. **`else`**: If the character is part of a word, it is added to the current word being built.
5. Finally, we add the last word (if any) to the list of tokens.

### Example Query Walkthrough

Let’s go through an example to see how this code works. Suppose the query is `"apple AND banana OR cherry"`.

1. **Tokenization**: The query is split into the tokens: `["apple", "AND", "banana", "OR", "cherry"]`.
2. **Processing Tokens**:
    - **"apple"**: `searchWord("apple")` is called, and a set of document IDs containing "apple" is pushed onto `operands`.
    - **"AND"**: The operator `AND` is pushed onto the `operators` stack.
    - **"banana"**: `searchWord("banana")` is called, and a set of document IDs containing "banana" is pushed onto `operands`.
    - **"OR"**: Before pushing `OR` onto the `operators` stack, we apply the `AND` operator (because `AND` has higher precedence).
        - This results in the intersection of the sets containing "apple" and "banana".
    - **"cherry"**: `searchWord("cherry")` is called, and a set of document IDs containing "cherry" is pushed onto `operands`.
3. **Final Operator Application**: After all tokens are processed, the final `OR` operator is applied, merging the results of "apple AND banana" and "cherry".
4. The result is a set of document IDs matching the query.

This method provides a robust way to evaluate Boolean expressions with multiple terms and operators, leveraging stacks to handle operator precedence and operand evaluation efficiently.
