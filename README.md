This is purely for learning and whatever questions I asked chatgpt during the implementation I have summarized those here


Here’s a comprehensive `README.md` file that explains your Java-based search engine project in depth, comparing **Naive**, **Inverted Index**, and **Trie** approaches. It outlines their trade-offs, use cases, and performance implications — perfect for writing a blog or showcasing your work.

### 📘 `README.md`: Java Search Engine – Naive vs. Inverted Index vs. Trie

---

## 🔍 Overview

This Java-based search engine supports three core search implementations:
- **Naive Linear Scan**
- **Inverted Index**
- **Trie-Based Indexing**

Each approach is implemented to support:
- Word search
- Phrase search
- Prefix search

The goal is to understand the trade-offs between these techniques, their performance characteristics, and which to use depending on your application's needs.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Full-text word search
- ✅ Phrase search
- ✅ Prefix search (autocomplete-style)
- ✅ Multiple indexing strategies
- ✅ Easy benchmarking and extensibility

---

## 🧠 Implementations

### 1. Naive Search (O(n))
#### ✅ Description:
Iterates through each document and checks if a word or phrase exists using `String.contains()`.

#### ✅ Pros:
- Simple and easy to implement.
- No preprocessing or additional memory overhead.

#### ❌ Cons:
- Inefficient for large datasets.
- Repeated scanning for every query.

#### ✅ Use Cases:
- Small-scale applications or prototyping.
- Situations where indexing is not feasible.

---

### 2. Inverted Index

#### ✅ Description:
Maps each word to the set of document IDs where it appears.

```java
Map<String, Set<Integer>> invertedIndex;
```

#### ✅ Pros:
- Fast lookups (`O(1)` per word).
- Easy to store additional metadata (e.g., frequency, position).
- Scales well with large document sets.
- Suitable for disk-based storage and compression.

#### ❌ Cons:
- Phrase search is approximate unless you store word positions.
- Slower for prefix matching unless iterating through all keys.

#### ✅ Use Cases:
- Real-world search engines (Elasticsearch, Lucene).
- Scalable systems with billions of documents.

---

### 3. Trie-Based Search

#### ✅ Description:
Stores words character-by-character in a prefix tree (Trie). Each node stores document IDs that share that prefix.

```java
class TrieNode {
    Map<Character, TrieNode> children;
    Set<Integer> documentIds;
    boolean isEndOfWord;
}
```

#### ✅ Pros:
- Extremely fast prefix search.
- In-memory autocomplete with low latency.
- Can be extended for fuzzy search or spell check.

#### ❌ Cons:
- High memory consumption due to character-level granularity.
- Redundant document ID storage across nodes.
- Not disk-friendly or compressible like inverted index.

#### ✅ Use Cases:
- Autocomplete suggestions.
- Spell-check engines.
- In-memory search on small-to-medium datasets.

| Feature               | Naive           | Inverted Index           | Trie                      |

| Search Speed          | ❌ Slow           | ✅ Fast                    | ✅ Fast (prefix only)      |
| Memory Efficiency     | ✅ High           | ✅ Moderate (scalable)     | ❌ Low (many nodes)        |
| Phrase Matching       | ✅ Exact match    | ✅ Approximate (needs post-check) | ✅ With post-check    |
| Prefix Matching       | ❌ Inefficient    | ❌ Inefficient             | ✅ Efficient               |

## 🧪 How to Run

```java
List<Document> docs = List.of(
    new Document(1, "apple pie and banana smoothie"),
    new Document(2, "banana apple fruit salad"),
    new Document(3, "chocolate pie and lemon tart")
);

SearchEngine.buildInvertedIndex(docs);
SearchEngine.buildTrieIndex(docs);

// Example queries
SearchEngine.naiveSearch(docs, "banana");
SearchEngine.invertedIndexSearchPhrase("banana apple", docs);
SearchEngine.searchPrefix("ban");
```

## 🧵 Design Trade-offs

| Decision | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| `Trie` nodes store document IDs per character | Enables fast prefix queries, but duplicates storage |
| `Inverted Index` only stores complete words | Memory efficient, good for keyword-based search |
| Phrase matching uses post-check in both `Inverted Index` and `Trie` | Avoids tracking word positions for simplicity |
| `Trie` vs. `Inverted Index` are both implemented | To benchmark and understand trade-offs in real scenarios |

## 🧑‍🏫 Learning Outcomes

- Understand foundational search strategies in information retrieval.
- Get hands-on with trie and hashmap-based indexing.
- Analyze trade-offs in speed vs. memory vs. complexity.
- Prepare for system design/LLD interviews involving search.

---

## 🧩 Possible Extensions

- Store word positions for exact phrase search using inverted index.
- Compress trie with DAWG (Directed Acyclic Word Graph).
- Add ranking (TF-IDF, BM25).
- Index and search large files using memory-mapped IO.
